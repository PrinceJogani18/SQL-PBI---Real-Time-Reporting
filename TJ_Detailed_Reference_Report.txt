TJ Project: Detailed Reference Report for Self-Use

---

Objective
To build a simple but powerful real-time manufacturing data simulation using SQL and visualize it using Power BI.

Step-by-Step Explanation (Simple Language)

1. Created a Database and Table in MySQL
CREATE DATABASE TJ;
- This gave me a clean workspace

CREATE TABLE TJ (...);
- I created a table to store each second's data — things like load usage, temperature, materials going in and out, and how many units were red, green, blue, or damaged.

2. Created a Stored Procedure (insert_loop)
- This procedure is a kind of loop that runs forever unless manually stopped
- Every second it:
  - Picks random values (using RAND()) to simulate real-world data
  - Calculates input and output material
  - Tracks how many units are red/green/blue or damaged
  - Updates running totals (using SUM() and IFNULL())
  - Waits one second using DO SLEEP(1);

3. Started the Loop
CALL insert_loop();
- I manually called the procedure to start data streaming
- Each row inserted represented one second in a live production environment
- I stopped the loop when needed by restarting MySQL Workbench or killing the session

4. Monitored Insertions
SELECT * FROM TJ ORDER BY T DESC LIMIT 1;
- This helped me check if the loop was working and inserting rows correctly

5. Power BI Connection and Visualization
- I connected Power BI to MySQL
- Built gauges for temperature and load
- Created time-series visuals showing colors completed, damaged units, and material flow
- Added custom formatting for clarity
- Set manual refresh or used DirectQuery for near real-time data viewing

Key Concepts I Practiced
- Stored Procedures
- Infinite Loops
- Live Data Simulation
- Time-Series Visualization in Power BI
- SQL Functions (RAND, SUM, IFNULL, FLOOR)

Real-World Use Case
This is like how factories or sensors push machine data every second. I simulated that system using pure SQL and made it visual in Power BI. It’s simple, real-time, and useful for live dashboards.

In One Line:
"I built a real-time manufacturing data simulator using MySQL and visualized it in Power BI using automated inserts and timestamp-based analytics."
